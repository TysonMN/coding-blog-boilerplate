Up to this point in my computer science career, I have mostly built data driven applications such as websites, integrations, or reports. While this is a great need in our world today, I feel myself being called back into data science. I graduated with a physics degree and am no stranger to algorithms or complex mathematics so this should be a fairly easy transition...right?

I started as any modern scientist would...with google. I found myself reading articles heavy in ML lingo and watching youtube videos that we slightly helpful but I could tell this was going to take much longer than I expected. Digging in a little bit deeper, I committed to Coursera and began [this course for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) taught by Andrew Ng. I can't recommend this course enough. After 6 weeks, life happened and I had to postpone the course but I began searching for a way to express my new skills and start adding to my portfolio. I plugged into a few data science communities thinking that I could siphon some creativity or lock in some accountability for that ever so coveted first project. It seemed like everyone was already farther down the road than me. I was deflated by the realization that any exciting project was backed by a private enourmous dataset, a large company and a reputation in the community.

Now it was time to change my attack. I needed to achieve something easier, something simpler. Even if 100,000 people had already done it and I followed a tutorial to the 'T'. So I revisited some of my search results and landed on [Kaggle](kaggle.com). They have great public data sets, a large community, competitions and even tools to break down the barrier of entry. I humbly chose the introductory challenge and began working. I have a good familiarity with C# and was curious to complete the challenge in Microsoft's functional language F#. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Microsoft has a good amount of support using ML.net and some plugins within Visual Studio to help with training the models. So I decided to accomplish the challenge using ML.net, F# and VSCode. I quickly became frustrated and realized that I had lost focus once again. I was self imposing too many barriers and instead needed to choose the path of least resistance. So, with my new electric vigor, I pulled up the first tutorial on the Titanic kaggle competition using C# and finished the task. After that burden was lifted, I went back and worked through the solution again using F#. This was a great reminder to my earlier days of programming: make it work, make it pretty, make it fast. I often think that I can invent the lightbulb on the first try only to get stuck in analysis paralysis. Of course it take many iterations to get software into something production ready.
